# dan-booth.github.io archive procedure

Since only the root level of `dan-booth.github.io` will be used to build the website at <https://dan-booth.github.io> we need to add the old root files to their own archive folder.

If you ever want to switch out what lives at the root you can just `mv` the contents of the archive folder back to the root level.
